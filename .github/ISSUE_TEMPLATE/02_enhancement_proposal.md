## Background and motivation

<!--
We welcome enhancement proposals!
This template will help us gather the information we need to discuss your proposal and possibile implementation.

First, please describe the purpose and value of the new functionality here:
  * what problem does it solve?
  * which type(s) of users / projects does it affect?
  * is it specific to some usage scenario?

Please include as many code snippets, CI log fragments, screenshots, etc. you deem useful to illustrate your point.
For texts spanning more than a few lines, please create a gist here https://gist.github.com/ and provide a link to it.

Don't forget to use syntax highlighting for Markdown code blocks. For example:

```C#
    public void SayHello(string name)
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
```

GitHub's syntax highlighting supports more languages that would be practical to list here.
Here's the complete list: https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml

## Proposed enhancement

<!--
Please describe the desired behavior, i.e. _what_ the library should do, not _how_ (that belongs to the next section).
For example: There should be a default value for parameter widgetName in WidgetManager.CreateWidget.
-->

## Implementation proposals

<!--
If you have an idea (or more than one) about _how_ the desired behavior can be implemented, please explain it here.
Be as detailed as your knowledge of the project allows. If you don't know the project's internals, but have some idea
or gut feeling about the way to go, feel free to say so. You won't be judged. We're all here to learn.
Any level of detail, from "I don't know" to specific code snippets, is fine.
-->

## Usage examples

<!--
Please provide example code and/or project snippets that highlight how the proposed enhancement will affect user projects.
-->

## Risks

<!--
Please mention any risks that to your knowledge the proposed enhancement might entail:
  * breaking changes
  * performance regressions
  * security issues
  * possible incompatibilities
  * added or changed dependencies
  * etc.
-->
