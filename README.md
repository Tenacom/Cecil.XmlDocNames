# Cecil.XmlDocNames
Cecil.XmlDocNames is a small .NET Standard 2.0 library that generates XmlDoc-style names
for Mono.Cecil member references. It has no dependencies apart from the .NET Standard library and Mono.Cecil.

XmlDoc names are also used by [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) in its
[external annotations](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Code_Analysis__External_Annotations.html)
files, which is why I wrote this library in the first place.
